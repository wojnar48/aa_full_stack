# README

Lax is a real-time messaging and collaboration full stack application inspired by Slack.

Live Site:[https://lax-app.herokuapp.com/#/]

## Implementation & Features

Lax is composed of a React/Redux front-end that communicates with a back-end RESTful API implemented with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Live chat features
were implemented using Rails' ActionCable.

### Authentication

The application has custom authentication logic developed from scratch using the BCrypt gem. User passwords are digested and stored in
the database as hashes that are used by the SessionsController to manage login/logout logic. On successful login, each user is assigned a url-safe session
token generated by the SecureRandom gem which is then stored in the current user's cookies to keep track of the current session.

### Organization

Messages are organized into public channels and direct messages. Public channels are open to all registered users while direct messages are initiated
by direct invitation and are only visible to the specified participants.

### Live Chat

Lax's live chat feature was implemented using Rails' ActionCable which allows for real-time, bidirectional communication via websockets.
On the front-end, this was accomplished using the npm actioncable package which allows clients (customers) to subscribe to and stream from broadcast
channels set up on the back-end. Each time a message creation action occurs in the database, controllers trigger broadcast jobs that transmit the message
to all subscribers.
